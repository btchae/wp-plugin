# LeeanPlugin
Barebones modular WordPress plugin

## Getting Started

1. Make a copy of this repo on your local machine.
1. In ``leeanp.php`` make the following changes:
    - Update the Plugin Name and Description in the comments at the top.
    - Update ```LeeanPlugin``` on line 18 to your plugin's name.
    - Leave everything else the same for now (We suggest leaving all the constants with the prefix ```LEEANP``` for simplicity).
    
We also suggest leaving the root namespace as ```Leeanp``` to save further set-up steps. 

LeeanPlugin ships with a few useful modules set-up in ```composer.json``. You can add or remove them as required.
